#Chapter Two Communication and the Use of Language

## Ubiquitous Language

A project faces serious problems when its language is fractured. Domain experts use their jargon while technical team members have their own language tuned
for discussing the domain in terms of design.

The terminology of day-to-day discussions is disconnected from the terminology embedded in the code (ultimately the most important product of a software 
project). And even the same person uses different language in speech and in writing, so that the most incisive expressions of the domain often emerge in a
transient from that is never captured in the code or even in writing.

Translation blunts communication and makes knowledge crunching anemic.

Yet none of these dialects can be a common language because none servers all needs.

## Modeling Out Loud

Play with the model as you talk about the system. Describe sceenarios out loud using the elements and interactions of the model, combining concepts in ways
allowed by the model. Find easier ways to say what you need to say, and then take those new ideas back down to the diagrams and code.
