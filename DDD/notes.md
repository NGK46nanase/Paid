#Chapter Two Communication and the Use of Language

## Ubiquitous Language

A project faces serious problems when its language is fractured. Domain experts use their jargon while technical team members have their own language tuned
for discussing the domain in terms of design.

The terminology of day-to-day discussions is disconnected from the terminology embedded in the code (ultimately the most important product of a software 
project). And even the same person uses different language in speech and in writing, so that the most incisive expressions of the domain often emerge in a
transient from that is never captured in the code or even in writing.

Translation blunts communication and makes knowledge crunching anemic.

Yet none of these dialects can be a common language because none servers all needs.

## Modeling Out Loud

Play with the model as you talk about the system. Describe sceenarios out loud using the elements and interactions of the model, combining concepts in ways
allowed by the model. Find easier ways to say what you need to say, and then take those new ideas back down to the diagrams and code.

## One Team, One Language

## Documents and Diagrams

a UML diagram cannot convey two of the most important aspects of a model: the meaning of the concepts it represents, and what the objects are meant to do.

*The vital detail about the design is captured in the code.*

*the mocdle is not the diagram*. The diagram's purpose is to help communicate and explain the model.

### Written Design Documents

#### Documents Should Complement Code and Speech

*A document shouldn't try to do what the code already does well.* The code already supplies the detail. It is an exact specification of program behavior.
Documents can clarify design intent when the programming language does not support a straightforward implementation of a concept. Written documents should complement the code and the talking.

#### Documents Should Work for a Living and Stay Current

The greatest value of a design document is to explain the concepts of the model, help in navigating the detail of the code, and perhaps give some insight into the model's intended styple of use.

*A document must be involved in project activites.* 

By Keeping documents minimal and focusing them on *complementing* code and conversation, documents can stay connected to the project.
