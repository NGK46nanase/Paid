To find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings
if there is no common prefix, return an empty string ```""```.

example 1:
```
Inputs: str = ["flower","flow","flight"]
Outputs: "fl"
```

example 2:
```
Input: strs = ["dog","racecar","car"]
Output: ""
Explanation: There is no common prefix among the input strings.
```

Constraints: 
* ```1<= strs.length <=200 ```
* ``` 0 <=strs[i].length <=200 ```
* ``` strs[i] consists of only lowercase english letters ```


Solutions:

time complexity: O(S) , iterate the whole array length
space complexity: O(1). used constatnt extra space
